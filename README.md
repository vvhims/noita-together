## What is Noita Together?
Noita Together is an attempt to bring a slight multiplayer aspect to the game, think of it more like everyone is in different dimensions yet you can still see other players and somewhat interact with each other you can not directly affect other player's worlds

it consists of an app made with electron for the twitch authentication and making/joining rooms and some other things and a lua mod that communicates with the app in-game 
mod uses [pollws](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/pollws/) made by probable-basilisk (fakepyry / pyry)
